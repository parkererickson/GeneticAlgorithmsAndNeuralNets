# GeneticAlgorithmsAndNeuralNets
Application of a Genetic Algorithm to Build Neural Network in Keras

### Goal of Project:
To learn more about the possible applications of optimizing the construction of neural networks with genetic algorithms.  While not very computationally efficient, especially with more complex datasets, it is more efficient than brute forcing an optimal architecture.   The goal of the project is to explore the feasibilty to feed the algorithm any dataset, and it could evolve into an efficient and optimal architecture for the data.  While the project is currently only using sequential architecture and the iris dataset, it is the hope that it would eventually be able to train off of datasets such as MNIST to learn convolutional and recurrent architectures.
